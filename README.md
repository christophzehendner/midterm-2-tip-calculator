# midterm-2-tip-calculator

This is a file where I explain how I coded the tip calculator:

1. I spent several hours to get running the repository. Unfortunately I didn't get it running on my Mac with your description on the web apps side. Luckily I found a workaround. I downloaded the the official github app and created a repository. Then I linked the github repository with Visual Studio code. Now you should see all the history of my code on the github repository.

2. I created the whole html code from top to button of the website. I already created the not yet existing css classes like outerbox, inp-wrapper or people-outerbox.

3. I copied all the given colours to the css file.

4. Then I tried to build the tip calculator as close as possible to the design which I saw on the design images. I always opened the picture and put it side by side with my website. First I created the desktop view (more than 1366 pixel) and after that the same procedure again. Sometimes it was quite difficult to match both designs. I used a lot of websites like w3schools to help me with some lines of code. If I changed one thing it got really messy. But I think at the end the design matches quite well.

5. For me the most difficult part was the java script part. To be honest I am not an expert of java script, because it's quite complex. Because of that I watched several YouTube tuturials which basicly coded a similar tip calculator. After some hours of copying the code I finally managed to make it work.
