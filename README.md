# midterm-2-tip-calculator

this is a file where I explain how I coded the tip calculator:

1. I spent several hours to get running the repository. Unfortunately I didn't get it running on my Mac with your description. Luckily I found a workaround. I downloaded the the official github app and created a repository. Then I linked the github repository with Visual Studio code. Now you should see all the history of my code on the github repository.

2. I created the whole html code from top to button of the website. I already created the not yet existing css classes.

3. I copied all the given colours to the css file.
